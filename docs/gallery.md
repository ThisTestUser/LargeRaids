The firework rockets have the same explosive power as those made from 5 fireballs and will not damage the shooter or any other raiders. They also have double the health of normal pillagers.

Villagers/players caught directly in his lines of explosions will be sent up high enough to die from fall damage if not under any kind of protection. The explosions created by the bomber have no effect on other raiders. TNTs dropped by bomber vexes, however, deal damage to anyone in the vicinity.

They also summon vexes holding diamond swords, enchanted with Fire Aspect II and Sharpness III. The fire fangs they create deals 3 hearts of damage regardless of protection, and set his targets on fire. Juggernauts are also tough to deal with. They have three times the health of normal ravagers, which also regenerates really fast. Kill it faster!
